# Secura
As my first public project that I hope to see finished some day, I chose to make a security one, very hard, but I'll try to make it small, after a security breach in a website I lost many personal data and credentials, it was a pain to change the many passwords linked to the e-mail and accounts with simmilar credentials. So to solve the confusion that originated by my lack of awareness of wich account used wich e-mail and wich password, I am making a program with the purpose of not only storing them, but to help you link credentials to apps and services so, when a data breach occours, you know wich passwords to change.
 
I do recognize that solutions for password storing and generating existed for ages and in a much complex shape, and I do agree that those are a great tool, but I think that the constant use of the password creation method and autofills harm your hability of remembering them and, even if you use only for storage, I just don't like a online application that stores your credentials, so I want to build much simpler than those password storing solution totally offline and local hosted, I may succeed or not, but the experience building it will be good enough.
